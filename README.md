# Productivity App – School Project

This project was built by three students at Nackademin as part of a two-week sprint assignment.  
It was our **very first project in React**, and the goal was to create a productivity-focused web app where users could manage their daily todos, habits, and events in one place.

We used React for the frontend, and localStorage/sessionStorage to persist user data.  
Each of us was responsible for one main part of the app. I focused on the **todo functionality** – including creating, editing, deleting, filtering, and sorting tasks based on status, category, deadline, and time estimate.
